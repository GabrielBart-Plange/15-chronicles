# Novelpedia Feature Comparison (Benchmarking)

This document outlines features found on `author.novelpedia.net` that are currently absent or less developed in `Vellum`. These serve as potential "Premium" or future development targets.

## 🛠️ Exclusive Author Tools

- **Auto-Translation Engine**: Instant translation to break global language barriers (likely using AI integration).
- **Publishing Scheduler**: "One-click" scheduling of chapters for future release times.
- **Premium Stockpile / Advance Chapters**: A sophisticated "Privilege" system where authors can maintain a buffer of chapters (e.g., 5-10) that are only accessible to paying subscribers. The platform handles the rolling release automatically.
- **Embedded Polls**: Interactive elements directly within chapters to gather reader feedback on plot points or character choices.

- **No Reader "Daily Passes"**: Focuses on direct support over predatory retention mechanics.

## 👥 Community & Support
